#RSA Cryptography Implementation in Java Using BigInteger Library
This project implements the RSA cryptographic algorithm for both encryption and decryption processes in Java, utilizing the BigInteger library.

#Comparison of Throughput Between AES and RSA Algorithms
This implementation provides a means to compare the throughput of encryption processes between AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA algorithms.

The project offers insights into the performance differences between AES and RSA algorithms in terms of encryption throughput. Throughput comparisons are conducted by measuring the speed at which these algorithms process encryption tasks.
